Raspberry Pi powered Display Frame with a filter site

# Description
This script was inspired from https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe

I liked the idea of a RPi powered frame where I could upload the scans of my comic books and display them with the rest of my Comic Book Room. My requirements were to have a frame that could be updated automatically and then be able to apply somw filtering based off of my collection. I have used the  Comic Collectorz https://www.collectorz.com/comic app for a number of years. Prior to them syncing with the could I had my collection in Dropbox so I knew I had a way to get my images to the frame.

## Requirements
1. Parse an export from Collectorz Comics for filter information
2. Automatically start 
3. Launch a site that can set filters, changing the images shown
